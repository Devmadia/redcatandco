# Red Cat and Co

# Description
COVID-19 brought swift change to the world. Small business owners felt the intense pressure to adapt. Unable to maintain a storefront appearance due to physical spacing limitations and safety concerns, Red Cat & Co transitioned to a virtual shopping experience with a â€™70s vibe to present local small business merchandise in one convenient location all at the click of a button.

This is an interactive MERN stack single page application (SPA) fulfilling client needs for a revamped, versatile website.
